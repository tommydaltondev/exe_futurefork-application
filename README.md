Future Fork is an interactive multimedia design project that was featured in the Starts/Speculations: Graphic Design in Chicago Past and Future exhibition June 12, 2014â€“September 30, 2014. I created this piece with Chicago artist, Jonathan Petersen for the exhibition. The animation functions are developed in object-oriented programming ActionsScript3 and it's mathematically impossible for Future Fork to repeat itself once it is launched.
