Future Fork is an interactive multimedia design project that was featured in the Starts/Speculations: Graphic Design in Chicago Past and Future exhibition June 12, 2014â€“September 30, 2014. The animation functions are developed in ActionsScript3 and it's mathematically impossible for Future Fork to repeat itself once it is launched.
